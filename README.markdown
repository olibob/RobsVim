### [Surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround.git)

The plugin provides mappings to easily delete, change and add such surroundings in pairs.

### [Tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar.git)
--------------------------------------------------
Tagbar is a vim plugin for browsing the tags of source code files. It provides
a sidebar that displays the ctags-generated tags of the current file, ordered
by their scope. This means that for example methods in C++ are displayed under
the class they are defined in.

### [Nerdcommenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter.git)
The NERD commenter provides many different commenting operations and styles
which are invoked via key mappings and a menu. These operations are available
for most filetypes.

### [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic.git)
Syntastic is a syntax checking plugin that runs files through external syntax checkers and displays any resulting errors to the user. This can be done on demand, or automatically as files are saved. If syntax errors are detected, the user is notified and is happy because they didn't have to compile their code or execute their script to find them.

### [Vim-ruby](https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby.git)
This project contains Vim configuration files for editing and compiling Ruby within Vim.
